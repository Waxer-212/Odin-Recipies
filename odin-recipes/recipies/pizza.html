    <p>All pizza dough starts with the same basic ingredients: flour, yeast, water, salt, and olive oil. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of what I use in my homemade pizza crust recipe. The full printable recipe is below.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Cornmel</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Stepts :</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer. Do this in steps as described in the written recipe below.</li>
        <li>Knead: Knead by hand or with your mixer. I like doing this by hand.</li>
        <li>Rise: Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator</li>
        <li>Punch & shape: Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2. Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>Top it: Top with favorite pizza toppings</li>
        <li>Bake: Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
